## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained

### Training vs Inference

Understand the two fundamental phases of machine learning - how models learn from data and then apply that knowledge to new inputs.

### The ML Paradigm Shift

Traditional programming: **Input + Logic → Output**
Machine Learning: **Input + Output → Logic (Model)**

### Neural Network Learning

Learn how neural networks improve through backward error propagation, iteratively adjusting billions of parameters to minimize errors.

### LLMs as Pattern Matchers

Understand why LLMs are called "stochastic parrots" - sophisticated statistical systems that predict sequences without true comprehension.

### Generative vs Agentic AI

- **Generative AI**: Creates content (text, images, videos)
- **Agentic AI**: Takes autonomous actions using tools and multi-step planning
