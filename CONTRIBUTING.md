## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Content Quality

- **Clarity First**: Explanations should be clear and accessible to learners at various levels
- **Accuracy**: Ensure technical accuracy. Cite sources for claims when appropriate
- **Completeness**: Provide enough context for concepts to be understood
- **Simplicity**: Use simple language before introducing technical jargon
- **Examples**: Include real-world examples where they add value

### Writing Style

- **Active Voice**: Prefer "Neural networks learn patterns" over "Patterns are learned by neural networks"
- **Concrete Examples**: Supplement abstract concepts with practical examples
- **Progressive Complexity**: Introduce simple concepts before complex ones
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms throughout (e.g., don't switch between "ML" and "machine learning" randomly)

### Formatting Standards

#### Markdown Structure

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Keep headings descriptive and scannable
- Use code blocks with language identifiers:

```python
# Good
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Lists and Tables

- Use bulleted lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use tables for comparisons
- Keep table columns aligned

#### Links and References

- Use descriptive link text: `[PyTorch documentation](url)` not `[click here](url)`
- Ensure all links are working
- Link to authoritative sources (official docs, research papers)
